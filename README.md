# Interval-Observer-Nonlinear-System
# Interval Observer for Nonlinear Discrete-Time Systems

## Overview
This project designs an **Interval Observer** for a nonlinear discrete-time system. The goal is to estimate **upper and lower bounds** of system states under nonlinear dynamics and bounded uncertainties.

Developed using MATLAB, symbolic computation, and LMI-based synthesis techniques.
